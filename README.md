# Pixel Predictor

Pixel Predictor is a machine learning application designed to predict pixel coordinates in images using deep learning techniques. 

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Ingests image data for training and prediction.
- **Model Preparation:** Prepares the base model architecture for training.
- **Model Training:** Trains the model using the prepared data.
- **Prediction:** Predicts pixel coordinates in images using the trained model.
- **Web Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the prediction functionality.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aftabmallick/ml_pixel_predictor.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up project configurations according to your environment.

## Usage

1. Run the web application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Access the web interface in your browser and interact with the prediction functionality.

## Configuration

The project uses configuration files (e.g., YAML) to manage various parameters such as file paths, model hyperparameters, etc. Configuration classes are used to load and manage these configurations.
